# **Roll-A-Ball: Studio 1 Project**
> This is the submission for the COSC516 Studio 1.

## **1. Project Introduction**

Welcome to the **Roll-A-Ball** project. This project is about how to create a simple environment where a player controls a rolling ball on a plane while avoiding falling off the edges.

## **2. User Guide**

### **Running the Project**
1. Clone the repository from GitHub(or open with Github Desktop):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd RollABall
   ```
2. Open the project in Unity (tested on Unity version `6.00031f` or compatible versions).
3. Press the **Play** button in Unity's editor to start the game.

### **Controls**
- **Movement**:
  - Use **WASD** or arrow keys to control the ball's movement on the plane.
- **Jump**:
  - Press **Space** to make the ball jump (**ONLY** when the ball is on the ground).

### **Notes**
- The ball is affected by gravity, so be careful to avoid falling off the edges.
- If the ball cannot move or jump:
  - Ensure that ground objects are tagged as `Ground`.

## **4. Key Features** corresponding to marking criteria

1. **Physics-Driven Ball Movement**:
   - The ball's movement is powered by Unity's Rigidbody and AddForce system for dynamic interactions.
2. **Real-Time User Input**:
   - Keyboard inputs control the ball's direction and jumping actions in real time.
3. **Bonus Feature**:
   - A jumping mechanic is implemented with collision detection to prevent mid-air double jumps.
